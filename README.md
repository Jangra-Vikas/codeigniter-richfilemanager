# codeigniter-richfilemanager
Simple integration of the RichFileManager Package
(<https://github.com/servocoder/RichFilemanager>) into CodeIngiter.

**Installation**

-   Step 1: We will use the composer for integration so that it will be easy to install and upgrades.

-   Step 2:
    -   Tell the CodeIgniter to auto load the composer installed packages in
        application/vendor by set composer_autoland to TRUE
        `$config['composer_autoload'] = TRUE;` in
        application/config/config.php

-   Step 3:
    -   Add composer.json to codeigniter root folder if does not exit and add
        the following code
        ```javascript
            "require": {		
                    "servocoder/richfilemanager-php": "^1.2"
                },
            "config": {
                "vendor-dir": "application/vendor"        
            }	
        ```
-   Step 4:
    -   Run `compser install` in project root folder. 
    -   Composer will install richfilemanager-php and keep the files under
        application/vendor folder. CodeIgniter will autoload richfildemanager
        package to our project.

-   Step 5:
    -   Set the router (optional)
        1.  Add the following `$route['richfilemanager/(:any)'] =
            'richfilemanager/\$1`; an entry to application/config/routes.php
    -   Copy the following files into your project.
        1.  Server component Setup:
            -   application/config/richfilemanagerlib.php
            -   application/controllers/RichFilemanager.php
            -   application/logs/richfilemanager-log.php         
            -   application/libraries/RichFilemanagerLib.php

        2.  Client component Setup:
            -   application/views/richfilemanager.html
            -   config
            -   images

            -   libs
            -   src
